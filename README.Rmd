Write a nice description of your project here.
Imagine someone is looking at the project trying to figure out what its about, 
and what files to look for what.

Content:
- `data`: necessary data for the project. Do not write to it, only read from it. Don't commit to git history.  
- `R`: contains R custom functions you make and maybe use several places.  
- `docs`: documents, like Rmarkdown.  
- `scripts`: analysis scripts and pipelines. Reads from data, sources R and runs analyses. Writes outputs to `results` or `figures`.  
- `results`: code output and results.
